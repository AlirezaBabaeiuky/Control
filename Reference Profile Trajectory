To define profile trajectories for: Position, Velocity, and Acceleeration of  astage to pass through the desired locations with specific velocity and acceleration in a speified time. 
there are multiple methods to generate such trajectories' profiles (built-in blocks in simulink, deriving the profiles from first-principles equations).
